        <h2>A Note About This Piece</h2>
        <p>

          This is a web app that makes it easy to calculate how much time it takes for you to pay your monthly expenses.
          <br><br>
          
          According to the <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2022/#:~:text=Using%20the%20realized%20compensation%20measure,a%20typical%20worker's%20annual%20compensation." target="_blank">Economic Policy Institute</a>, from 1978-2022, CEO pay has increased 1,209.2% while the average worker's pay has grown 15.3% during that same time period.   
           
          <br><br>
          One of the cruelties of low wages is the time it takes away from a person's life. A low wage worker must work longer hours and have less time for non-work activities in order to pay for basic living costs. 
          
          <br><br>
          This web app allows a person to see their monthly budget in terms of their time. At your current pay rate, how long does it take for you to pay your rent? What about groceries? Insurance? Utilities? Student debt? 
          <br><br>
          The hope is this app will help people see how their time is utilized to pay for monthly expenses, and to think about what that says about how we treat the average worker.
